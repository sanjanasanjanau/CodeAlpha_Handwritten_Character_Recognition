### Introduction
Handwritten Character Recognition is a project aimed at identifying handwritten characters from images using machine learning techniques. This project leverages popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow to preprocess the data, build and train a neural network model, and visualize the results.

### Features
* Preprocessing of handwritten character images
* Building and training of neural network models using TensorFlow
* Visualization of training progress and results using Matplotlib
* Easy-to-use interface for recognizing handwritten characters

### Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow
* OpenCV
* scikit-learn

### Usage
* Preprocess the data: Load and preprocess your dataset to make it suitable for training the model.
* Build and train the model: Define the neural network architecture and train it using the preprocessed data.
* Visualize the results: Use Matplotlib to plot training progress and evaluate model performance.
* Save and load the model: Save the trained model for future use and load it when needed.

### Model Performance Metrics
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix to understand how well it recognizes handwritten characters.
